<h1>The Road Not Taken</h1>
<p class="author">by Robert Frost</p>

<p>TWO roads diverged in a yellow wood,</p>
<p>And sorry I could not travel both</p>
<p>And be one traveler, long I stood</p>
<p>And looked down one as far as I could</p>
<p>To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Then took the other, as just as fair,</p>
<p>And having perhaps the better claim,</p>
<p>Because it was grassy and wanted wear;</p>
<p>Though as for that the passing there</p>
<p>Had worn them really about the same,</p>
<p></p>
<p>And both that morning equally lay</p>
<p>In leaves no step had trodden black.</p>
<p>Oh, I kept the first for another day!</p>
<p>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,</p>
<p>I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I shall be telling this with a sigh</p>
<p>Somewhere ages and ages hence:</p>
<p>Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”</p>
<p>I took the one less traveled by,</p>
<p>And that has made all the difference</p>
