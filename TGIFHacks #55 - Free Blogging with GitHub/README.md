# TGIFHacks #55 - Free Blogging with GitHub

This is a tutorial that guides you through building a blog with Hugo and GitHub Pages. For the slides I used, you can download it [here](https://github.com/ntuoss/Workshops/raw/master/TGIFHacks%20%2355%20-%20Free%20Blogging%20with%20GitHub/slides.pdf).

## Installing hugo

Here we'll only cover how to install `hugo` on Ubuntu since we'll be using the Cloud9 platform. If you would like to install it on your own computer, please refer to this [link](https://gohugo.io/overview/installing/).

First, we download the package with the following command

```bash
$ wget https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases/download/v0.16/hugo_0.16-1_amd64.deb
```

Then we install the downloaded package to our system

```bash
$ sudo dpkg -i hugo*.deb
```

Now you should have `hugo` installed, type in the following command to check your installation

```bash
$ hugo version
# Hugo Static Site Generator v0.16 BuildDate: 2016-06-12T08:47:29Z
```

## Building your blog with Hugo

This section tells you how to actually use `hugo` to build your blog.

### Creating a new site

The first thing we need to do is to create our website, go to the folder where you want to store your website and type in the following command

```bash
$ hugo new site my-blog
```

This will create a folder in your current directory named `my-blog` and you will see some files generated by `hugo` in that folder.

```
[my-blog]/
├── [archetypes]/
├── config.toml
├── [content]/
├── [data]/
├── [layouts]/
├── [static]/
└── [themes]/
```

### Choosing a theme

Now that you have a site, the next thing you should do is to pick a theme for your site. Go to [Hugo Themes Site](https://themes.gohugo.io) to find a nice-looking theme for your blog! For our example here, we'll pick the [Hemingway theme](http://themes.gohugo.io/hemingway/). Type the following commands to install the theme to your site

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tanksuzuki/hemingway.git themes/hemingway
```

### Configure your theme

### Adding a post

Now you have your site and your theme, you need to put in some contents! Let's create a post for our blog with the following command

```bash
$ hugo new post/hello-world.md
```

You should see that now there is a file in `content/post` named `hello-world.md`

Open that file, and write something inside. The file uses the Markdown syntax. If you don't know any Markdown, don't worry! Plain text will work!

After you finish writing a post, you wanna undraft that post (it's a draft by default). Type in the following command to undraft it

```bash
$ hugo undraft content/post/hello-world.md
```

### Generating your blog

Ok, now you have everything you need to generate the actual website. And it's surprisingly easy. Just type in the following command

```bash
$ hugo server --theme=hemingway --baseURL=<your website URL> --bind=$IP --port=$PORT 
```

## Uploading your blog to GitHub Pages
